# Game100RusVoterV0

This was the first version of captcha breaker for game100rus site. Admin was notified in 2014 that captcha that he is using is WAY to easy. I was to lasy to investigate deeply data that goes from server to flash object and i was kinda intrested in checking image. No cool things like CUDA here :( And v1 is here https://github.com/DynamicSTOP/Game100RusVoter
